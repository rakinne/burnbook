# Digital Burn Book

## Overview

The Digital Burn Book is a satirical social commentary project exploring the potential misuse of AI in creating and spreading misinformation. It simulates a fictional application where users can generate fake but realistic content about fabricated individuals, mimicking the "Burn Book" concept from the movie Mean Girls but in a present-day, AI-driven context.

**Disclaimer:** This project is purely fictional and intended for educational and critical discussion purposes. It does not endorse or encourage the creation or dissemination of harmful content in the real world. The AI generates content about fabricated individuals only.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Uses advanced AI models to create deepfakes, fake social media posts, text messages, and news articles.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:**  A web-based UI built with Flask, allowing users to easily create and manage "burns."
*   **Social Media Simulation:** Mimics the dynamics of social media platforms, including likes, shares, and comments (within a controlled environment).
*   **Data Management:** Stores user data, target profiles, and generated content in a database.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Python, Flask
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **AI Libraries:** (To be determined - DeepFaceLab, Transformers, etc.)
*   **Database:** SQLite (for development)
